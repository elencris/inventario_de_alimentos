The dataset includes 382 images.
Leite-refrigerante-lanches-fruta are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 320x320 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -14° to +14° horizontally and -14° to +14° vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -14 and +14 percent
